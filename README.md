# weather-forecast

## Description
With this challenge the goal was to create a weather app that uses a 3rd party API to gather data. When the user interacts with the website they must first input a city. When entered, the site populates with data based on that location. A current weather report in addition to a 5 day forecast is presented along with the following criteria for each: Current temperature, wind speed, humidity, and an icon that represents the current conditions.
